The source code for AI can vary widely depending on the specific type of AI being developed, the programming language being used, and the purpose of the AI. However, here is an example of a basic AI source code in Python for a simple chatbot

This simple chatbot program takes user input and responds with a pre-defined greeting if the input matches one of several possible greetings. If the input does not match any of the greetings, the chatbot responds with a generic message indicating that it does not understand the input. This code could be expanded upon to include more complex natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, and other AI techniques.
